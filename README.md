# Project Overview:
* Data Source:
  
The dataset, available in Excel format, includes employee code, names, and dates for a three-month period, with each date represented in separate columns.

* Data Preparation:
  
The initial step involves importing the data into Power BI and performing essential data cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates.

* Data Transformation:
  
Extensive data transformation takes place in Power Query, including unpivoting dates into a single column. This process is applied across all sheets in the dataset.

* Data Analysis and Visualization:

Leveraging DAX functions like SWITCH, SUM, CALCULATE, DIVIDE, and FORMAT, the dashboard calculates crucial metrics such as total working days, present days, WFH count, and sick leave count.

* Key Metrics and Visualizations:
  
The dashboard showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) like Present %, WFH %, and Sick Leave %. Additionally, detailed tables provide per-day percentages for Present %, WFH %, and line graphs depict trends over time.
